Overview - RubikSolver is a device which rotate every side of Rubik's Cube

Description - It contains STM32F407VG as microprocessor, power supply-4x1,5V battery,6x Servomotors Feetech fs90r, mobile application to rotate sides, bluetooth module BC417.

How to run - Connect to device via a bluetooth terminal and send characters 
(counter clockwise/clockwise)
e/r - top side
a/s - left side
d/f - front side
g/h - right side
c/v - bottom side
j/k - back side

spacebar - stops all servomotors.

How to compile - Just copy.

Future improvements - We want to create real algorithms to solve Rubik's Cube, enter some Encoders.
